This project is part of a non-professional programmer to create a free tool for world wide development of Medical Questionnaires. This myroot is the code sample to proof several issues to persons interesting to help our project, and to start introducing programming skills. Eventually, the goal is that you are able to use the program on your PC, for free, and create your own Medical Questionnaires, share your codes, and help patients to prepare for medical interventions by well informed physicians. View more about this project on my [Figshare](https://figshare.com/authors/Hans_Hendrickx/6880208) and my [Google Site](https://sites.google.com/view/mp50-org/). For professional help I review to [Sosaro](https://sosaro.com/en/).

The description will become available, work in progress. We built our own webserver for this small demo-project, great thanks to [Bryam Loaiza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryam-loaiza-a09b53126/).

This django-demo-project, sourced at [GitHub](https://github.com/balt1794/takeoff), and described in [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08H4W2WLD?pf_rd_r=CKQ4PMZXG5V9CG7FH60M&pf_rd_p=8fe9b1d0-f378-4356-8bb8-cada7525eadd&pd_rd_r=94544447-fe82-4846-8084-c9d7d5f68059&pd_rd_w=q8KtQ&pd_rd_wg=dbXiD&ref_=pd_gw_unk), and developed by [Bryam Loaiza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryam-loaiza-a09b53126/).

I use his project because it explains in some detail how to develop a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) website on my PC. The process of cloning shows the complexity of programming. However, non-programmers can understand the basics up to the point that they are able to start programming themselves. 

Programming for non-professionals, slowly, becomes easier by tools that take care of complex interactions among package/software versions:

1. The free [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) lets us understand how to understand and write code. To start is easy, just type code into the windows search field at the left lower corner of your computer.

2. [Python](https://www.python.org/) is a higher programming language and is installed on your computer by the free [Anaconda Individual](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) is used by millions of scientists to create python [Virtual Environments](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-you-should-use-a-virtual-environment-for-every-python-project-c17dab3b0fd0). That allows them to share their working codes easily. Try to repeat the cloning of this project and you will understand the complexity of software versions that need to cooperate.

3. The free [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/hanshendrickx/myroot/), and [GitKraken](https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwjwhPaVx672AhWDGgYAHfYzAY4YABAAGgJ3cw&ae=2&sig=AOD64_04BbcxGKVQoaT8X9ZhP2RbAR3plg&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjUpO-Vx672AhWONewKHcizCfcQ0Qx6BAgmEAE), all help version control of code and sharing software worldwide.

4. The open-source code for developing a website like the python based free [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Django-Wagtail](https://wagtail.org/) help to create simple as well as very complex websites.  


Assist patients to help their physicians to help CareFree HealthCare for all of us.
